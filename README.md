## üöÄ Introduction
Implementation of an NLP workflow that pre-processes patient/parent feedback of GOSH patient that comes in through data collection directly from parents with a mobile app or data entry by routine data entry the patient experience team engages in.

### Using the FFT pipeline

### Finetuning Workflow


For fine-tuning SetFit based pipeline components, please refer to [Setfit's documentation on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/setfit/how_to/classification_heads).


The base models used for Setfit fine-tuning are:

- Sentence Transformer for SetFit: [distilbert-base-uncased__sst5__all-train](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/distilbert)

Please note that the Sentiment model expects to be trained with labels below: "negative/neutral/positive" and the theme model expects to be trained with labels below:

- Unclassified
- Respect for patient-centred values
- Coordination and integration of care
- Information and education
- Physical comfort
- Emotional support
- Involvement of friends and family
- Transition and continuity
- Access to care
- General



### Workflow
This pipeline conducts the following tasks:
1. Data import of most recent data, which is mostly the previous day's entered comments from a Microsoft SQL database.
2. Automatic de-identification of patient and healthcare names from the comments.
3. Sentence splitting, which preprocesses the HTML data and smarty splits into separate individual sentences using tokenization.
4. Prediction of sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive) and theme, which spans across the following 10 NHS patient experience 2022 themes:
    - Unclassified,
    - Respect for patient-centred values
    - Coordination and integration of care
    - Information and education
    - Physical comfort
    - Emotional support
    - Involvement of friends and family
    - Transition and continuity
    - Access to care and
    - General
5. Sentence Rejoining based on similarity of sentiment and theme predictions for sentences coming from same comment, whilst maintaining their original order.

### Deployment
The FFT NLP pipeline has been packaged as a python application that incorporates code from the prediction, sentence splitting and auto-redaction. A docker image has been created based on Python 3.9.16, that runs a crontab file to automate the prediction.

However, the usability of this will depend on trust authentication policies. If it is not possible to use cron, e.g. if authentication credentials do not last long enough, then it can be run manually.


Output consists of:
1. Theme and sentiment classes.
2. Consensus  scores for theme prediction and sentiment prediction
3. Date the pipeline was ran
4. Version of the pipeline.

## üìö Installations

### Requirements
The models are built using a SetFit-DistilBERT model and the deberta-base-long-nli model is used to provide a confidence score is from Hugging Face.

#### To build FFT NLP docker image
If the image on the container registry cannot be pulled it can be built locally.

1. Clone FFT NLP pipeline repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/gosh-dre/FFT-NLP-Pipeline
```
2. Change directory to the root of the repo
```
cd fft
```

3. Build dependency image
```
docker build -f Dockerfile.dependency -t fft:fft_dependencies .
```

4. Specify key details in `config.yaml`. This includes the database FFT data is held in and the destination table for predictions.

5. Create docker image
```
docker build -t fft:main .
```

#### To run FFT NLP container

1. Make a folder `fft_log` on host system with a log file (`fft.log`)

2. Run the docker container
```
docker run --name fft_container fft run -v [full_path_to_folder]/fft_log:/app/fft_log -v [path to models]:/app/ext_models --name fft fft:main
```
where `fft_container` is the container name you want to assign to the docker image: `fft`. Note: logs will not be made unless the full path to the log folder is given.

3. Login/Enter the running container
```
docker exec -it fft_container /bin/bash
```

4. Authenticate connection to database and make any changed necessary to config.yaml, as described previously.

5. `python main.py`

6. The output can be inspected as described previously.
